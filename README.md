PHASE 2 MOCK ASSESSMENT
=======================

Phase 2 mock assessment was timed for 3 hours. In this time, we had to accomplich the following. There will be 2 branches, the master branch is uncompleted at the end of the assessment. Finished branch is my completed version for this project.

1) Include a join table and call funtionality.

2) Demostrate knowledge of basic css maipulation.

3) Add JavaScript to have boxes render color.

4) Have all passing tests in OOJS.

Getting Started
===============

1) run bundle, rake db:create, rake db:migrate, rake db:seed, then shotgun. Error I changed the file name to sinatra1, name must be changed back to just sinatra or fix the routing issue in the rake fail.

2) Open HTML in browser.

3) Run shotgun. Same issue as in sinatra1, the '3' must be removed or change route in gemfile.

4) Run Node zoo.js
